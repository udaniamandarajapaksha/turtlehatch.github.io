   <h1 class="ths">  Turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka</h1>
<h2 class="sri">sri Lankan turtle</h2>

 <div class="ps">
 The number of eggs laid varies with the individuals and also with the species of turtle. They 
    are covered with mucous when laid. Once the eggs are laid the nest chamber and the 
    depression are covered with sand and the female labours back to the sea, never to see her 
    progeny.
    Sometimes stray dogs and monitor lizards dig up the nests and eat the eggs. The trail made 
    by its flippers along the beach, which the turtle leaves as it comes ashore and goes off, help 
    the predators, including humans, to trace the position of the nest.
    The eggs take around 50 days to hatch and the hatchlings, as soon as they are born, make 
    their way to the sea. Crows, seagulls and other seabirds eat some of the hatchlings, which 
    are black, as they make their way on the white sand.
    Here again stray dogs and monitor lizards eat some hatchlings as they move across the 
    beach. The large fish that lurk in the shallows of the sea also eat some of the young ones 
    that just make it to the water. Only a few of the hatchlings that come out of each nest 
    survive to become mature adults.
    The main breeding season is from September to mid-April on the West coast of the island 
    and from February to June on the East coast. During these periods there are no monsoon 
    rains to dampen the eggs and also the beaches are very broad and sandy
