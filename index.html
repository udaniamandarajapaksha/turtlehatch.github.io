              <h3>Hawksbill sea turtle</h3>
              <p>
                Hawksbill turtles are found throughout the tropical waters of the Atlantic,
                 Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They avoid deep waters, preferring coastlines
                  where sponges are abundant and sandy nesting sites are within reach

              <h3> Green Turtle </h3>
              <p>
                The Green Turtle is the most commonly found turtle in Sri Lanka.
                 They are also found in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. 
                 Luckily this practice is less common today. Young Green Turtles
                  are mainly carnivores. Adults however are herbivores, 
                  feeding only on marine vegetation with the help of their finely serrated jaws.
               They grow to a maximum length of 1m and can weigh 250kg.
               Adult females lay between 120-140 eggs at one time.

                The Loggerhead Turtle is rare in Sri Lanka and is more commonly found on the East 
                Coast of America. They are usually red and brown in 
                colour and as its name suggests, is easily identifiable because of its large head!

              <h3>Olive Ridley Turtle</h3>
              <p>
                This turtle is endangered because the population depends on the security of a
                 small number of beaches found in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

              <h3>Leather-back Turtle</h3>
              <p>
                This critically endangered turtle is the largest of the 5 species and is a rare 
                find in Sri Lanka. It remains on the brink of extinction.
It is easily identifiable due to its long front flippers and unique black and white
 stripy shell - its carapace is in fact a layer of thin, tough, rubbery skin peppered
  with thousands of bone plates giving it 
a leathery appearance. It is in fact the only sea turtle that lacks a hard shell!

  <h3>
    POLLUTION AND PATHOGENS
  </h3>
  <p>
    Marine pollution can harm sea turtles in many ways. Plastic pollution, 
    discarded fishing gear, petroleum by-products, and other debris injure 
    sea turtles through ingestion and entanglement. Ocean pollution can also 
    weaken the turtles’ immune systems, and disrupt nesting behavior
     and hatchling orientation.

  <h3>
    FISHERIES BYCATCH
  </h3>
  <p>
    It’s estimated that the fishing industry 
    contributes to the death of thousands to tens 
    of thousands of sea turtles each year.
     Turtles that become trapped in
      longlines, gill nets and trawls 
      are thro wn away as bycatch. And
       those that manage to avoid fishing
        nets are impacted by the disruption to their food supply and habitat.

  <h3>
    CLIMATE CHANGE
  </h3>
  <p>
    We are just now learning the extent to 
    which climate change can affect sea 
    turtles. Climate change can impact the
     natural sex ratios of hatchlings, 
     increase the likelihood of disease 
     outbreaks, and can escalate the frequency of 
     extreme weather events, which destroy nesting beaches and coral reefs.
